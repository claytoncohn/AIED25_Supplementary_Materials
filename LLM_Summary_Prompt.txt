Students work to create computational models that simulate motion guided by kinematics. In this model, a truck, starting from rest, must accelerate to the speed limit. The truck must then cruise at the speed limit as long as it can before having to stop at a stop sign. The truck’s maximum acceleration is 4 m/s, and its maximum deceleration is -4 m/s. The speed limit is 15 m/s. The truck’s initial position is -60. The stop sign’s position is 38.16. The students have access to the following variables: acceleration, delta t, velocity, position, stop_sign_position. 

You are trying to help a teacher understand the students’ conversations in relation to the model segments they are constructing to create the full computational model of truck motion. You are not allowed to infer things that are not explicitly stated in the discourse segments when providing your summary but if you feel you cannot provide a sufficient summary based on the text provided, take your best guess anyway.

[If task context = Initializing Variables]: In this segment, the students are working on initializing the variables needed to model the truck’s motion.

[If task context = Updating Variables, Each Simulation Step]: In this segment, the students are working on updating variables, such as position and velocity, of the truck at each time step. 

[If task context = Updating Variables, Under Conditions]: In this segment, the students are working on updating variables under specific conditions by using variables, such as acceleration, to update the velocity or position of the truck. There are three possible behavior changes they may be working on: (1) accelerating the truck until it reaches the speed limit, (2) keeping the truck cruising when it reaches the speed limit, (3) decelerating the truck when it is at a distance or time away from the stop sign, calculated using the kinematic equations, such that it will come to a stop when it reaches the stop sign.

[If task context = Conditional Statements]: In this segment, the students are working on creating a conditional statement. There are four possible conditional behaviors they may be working on: (1) accelerating the truck until it reaches the speed limit, (2) keeping the truck cruising when it reaches the speed limit, (3) decelerating the truck when it is at a distance or time away from the stop sign, calculated using the kinematic equations, such that it will come to a stop when it reaches the stop sign, or (4) stopping the simulation when the truck reaches the stop sign. The value the students use in the conditional statement could either be calculated using the kinematic equations or is based upon the speed limit.

In the next section is the students' discourse. Each line in the discourse is an individual student utterance with the format SPEAKER : DISCOURSE. Based on these instructions and the context, summarize the following conversation.
